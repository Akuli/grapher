## Development Setup

Clone the repository and open index.html in your browser. It should work.

Even though this project runs entirely in a browser, you can lint it with nodejs
and eslint. Install a new enough nodejs, and run this command in this repository
to install the linter:

    $ npm install

Then you can lint:

    $ node_modules/eslint/bin/eslint.js js/*.js
